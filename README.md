Data Mining - Big Data Project 2017 - Uncertain Clustering.
<br>
U-DBSCAN is a density based algorithm that can cluster uncertain data using as distance measure a probabilistic distance between the random distributions of the points.
<br>
<b>Usage</b>:
1) Download the U-DBSCAN.jar file
2) If it is the first time that you run the algorithm and you want to use an existing dataset, create a new folder in your documents named "bdmpFiles" and inside it create a folder named "input". <br>
If, in your first execution, you don't want to use an existing dataset simply go to 4) point.
3) Put "dataset.txt" and "datasetInfo.txt" in the input folder
4) Execute it with "java -jar U-DBSCAN.jar"
5) Output will be saved into "bdmpFiles/output" folder
