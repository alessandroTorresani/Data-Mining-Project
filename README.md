Data Mining and big data Project - Uncertain Clustering 2017
U-DBSCAN is a density based algorithm that can cluster uncertain data.
Usage:
1) Download the U-DBSCAN.jar file
2) If you run it for the first time and you want to use an existing dataset, create a new folder in your documents named "bdmpFiles" and inside it create a folder named "input"
3) Put "dataset.txt" and "datasetInfo.txt" in the input folder
4) Execute it with "java -jar U-DBSCAN.jar"
5) Output is saved into "bdmpFiles/output" folder
