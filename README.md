Data Mining - Big Data Project 2017 - Uncertain Clustering.
<br>
U-DBSCAN is a density based algorithm that can cluster uncertain data using as distance measure a probabilistic distance between the random distributions of the points.
<br>
<b>Usage</b>:
1) Download the <i>U-DBSCAN.jar</i> file
2) If it is the <b>first time</b> that you run the algorithm and you want to <b>use an existing dataset</b>, create a new folder in your documents named <i>"bdmpFiles"</i> and inside it create a folder named <i>"input"</i>. <br>
If, in your first execution, you don't want to use an existing dataset simply go to 4) point.
3) Put <i>"dataset.txt"</i> and <i>"datasetInfo.txt"</i> in the input folder
4) Execute it with <b>"java -jar U-DBSCAN.jar"</b>
5) Output will be saved into "bdmpFiles/output" folder
