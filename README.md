Data Mining - Big Data Project 2017 - Uncertain Clustering.
<br>
U-DBSCAN is a density based algorithm that can cluster uncertain data.
<br>
<b>Usage</b>:
1) Download the U-DBSCAN.jar file
2) If you run it for the first time and you want to use an existing dataset, create a new folder in your documents named "bdmpFiles" and inside it create a folder named "input". If, in your first execution, you don't want to use an existing dataset simply go to 4) point.
3) Put "dataset.txt" and "datasetInfo.txt" in the input folder
4) Execute it with "java -jar U-DBSCAN.jar"
5) Output is saved into "bdmpFiles/output" folder
